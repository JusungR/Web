    <h1>Dropout</h1>
    <h1>Batch Normalization</h1>
One way to make deep networks easier to train is to use more sophisticated optimization procedures such as SGD+momentum, RMSProp, or Adam. Another strategy is to change the architecture of the network to make it easier to train. One idea along these lines is batch normalization which was proposed by <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167'>[1]</a> in 2015.
