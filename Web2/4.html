    Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
    Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
    Simple is better than complex.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:30px;">
    Complex is better than complicated.<br>
    Flat is better than nested. <br>
    Sparse is better than dense.<br>
    Readability counts.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:30px;">
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
    Although practicality beats purity.<br>
    Errors should never pass silently.<br>
    Unless explicitly silenced.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:30px;">
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:30px;">
    Now is better than never.<br>
    Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</p>
